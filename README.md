I made this for a job interview. I was rejected based on the utterly abysmal quality of my effort.

So I named the game "Rejection".

Anyhow, I decided to make it fun for *me* to play. I started by making a TTY/command-line version, but java is not real good at that and there was too much annoying screen-flashing when playing high-complexity layouts; so I am now finishing up a Swing version.
